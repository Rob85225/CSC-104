Create a new Readme.txt file with notepad.
This is different than your HTML and CSS files. This is considered documentation about your website, this is not your actual website or web pages.
Include a description of what the page(s) output in a readme.txt. This is as simple as "copy and paste" the assignment requirements.
Include the HTML and CSS page name(s) in your readme.txt file.
Use good formatted, easy-to-read, and commented CSS code.
